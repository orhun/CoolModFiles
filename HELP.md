## What is this?

It's a web player that works by simply fetching a random module from [modarchive.org](https://modarchive.org) and playing it. **No black magic involved!**

## How do I use it?

You can whether use your mouse/touchpad to click on the cyberpunk-themed cool icons or choose the dark path of hacky key bindings.

## What are modules?

Modules are a family of music files, which all originated back on the computer known as the **Commodore Amiga** in the late **1980s.**

A MOD file contains a set of instruments in the form of samples, a number of patterns indicating how and when the samples are to be played, and a list of what patterns to play in what order.

## Project History

The idea for **CoolModFiles** originated among two programmer friends who used to send mod files to each other, which lead to the creation of a personal
mod archive - one which had hundreds of cool modules at the time!
Being in possession of those rare works of art (all the way from 80s!) was a privilege...
When the awesome tracks started piling up, however, it naturally brought about a storage problem. The solution was simple: using a web archive!

The programmer friends' idea, unfortunately, was beaten by [modarchive.org](https://modarchive.org) many years ago. Realizing how unnecessary creating another internet archive was, the project evolved into a cool web player instead. A group of 3 came together to create what is known today as [CoolModFiles.com](https://CoolModFiles.com).
With it's modern look, it continues to surface thousands of long-forgotten mod files to introduce newer generations to the world of old-school digital music.
